# Define an array variable with the elements 1, 4, 7, 9
array_variable = [1, 4, 7, 9]
# Define 4 variables a, b, c, d
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
# Fully bracketed version of e = a * c - b / d
e = (a * c) - (b / d)
# Given line of code: e = a - b ** c // d + a % c
# Fully bracketed version:
e = (a - ((b ** c) // d)) + (a % c)
